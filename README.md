## 📋 Overview
This repository contains the test automation project for [Parking Cost Calculator](https://shino.de/parkcalc/). The project aims to validate the accuracy, functionality and error handling of the calculator through both manual and automated testing techniques.
## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript
- **Test Automation Frameworks**: Cypress, qUnit

## ✨ Features
- Automated functional tests for:
  - Parking cost calculations for all parking types.
  - Edge and boundary conditions (e.g., time transitions, weekly rates).
  - Input validations and error handling.
- Comprehensive manual test cases for UI/UX and responsiveness.

## 🧪 Testing Scope
### Functional Testing
- Validate parking cost calculations for:
  - **Valet Parking**: $18/day, $12 for ≤ 5 hours.
  - **Short-Term Parking**: $2 for the first hour, $1/additional 30 minutes, $24/day max.
  - **Long-Term Garage Parking**: $2/hour, $12/day max, $72/week (7th day free).
  - **Long-Term Surface Parking**: $2/hour, $10/day max, $60/week (7th day free).
  - **Economy Lot Parking**: $2/hour, $9/day max, $54/week (7th day free).
  
### Non-functional Testing(Upcoming)
- **Performance Testing**: Simulate multiple users accessing the calculator simultaneously.
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure compatibility with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.

## 📝 Test Plan
The test plan includes:
1. **Manual Test Cases**:
   - Available in the `/test-cases` folder.
   - Covers UI/UX, responsiveness, and boundary conditions.

2. **Automated Test Scenarios**:
   - Scripts located in the `/automation-tests` folder.
   - Written using qUnit and Cypress
